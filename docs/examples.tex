\section{Example Use Cases}

Our tool can be applied to a wide range of use cases in various fields, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engineering:} Simulating mechanical systems such as vehicles, machines, and structures to analyze their performance and behavior under different conditions.
    \item \textbf{Physics Education:} Demonstrating principles of physics such as motion, forces, and energy conservation through interactive simulations.
    \item \textbf{Game Development:} Prototyping and testing game mechanics and physics simulations for realistic gameplay experiences.
    \item \textbf{Research:} Conducting scientific research and experiments by simulating complex physical phenomena and analyzing the results.
\end{itemize}

These are just a few examples of the many potential use cases for our tool.

\section{Step-by-Step Walkthroughs of Simulations}

We provide step-by-step walkthroughs of several simulations to demonstrate how our tool can be used to model and analyze different systems. These walkthroughs include:

\subsection{Quarter Car Model Simulation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Setup:} Define parameters such as mass, spring stiffness, and damping coefficient for the car body and suspension components.
    \item \textbf{Simulation:} Start the simulation and observe the motion of the car body and suspension system over time.
    \item \textbf{Analysis:} Analyze the behavior of the suspension system, including the response to bumps and uneven terrain.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pendulum Simulation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Setup:} Define parameters such as pendulum length, mass, and initial angle.
    \item \textbf{Simulation:} Start the simulation and observe the oscillation of the pendulum under the influence of gravity.
    \item \textbf{Analysis:} Measure the period and frequency of oscillation, and compare with theoretical predictions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mass Spring System Simulation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Setup:} Define parameters such as mass, spring constant, and initial displacement.
    \item \textbf{Simulation:} Start the simulation and observe the oscillation of the mass on the spring.
    \item \textbf{Analysis:} Measure the amplitude, frequency, and energy of oscillation, and analyze the damping effect.
\end{enumerate}

These walkthroughs provide hands-on experience with our tool and demonstrate its capabilities for modeling and analyzing various systems.

\section{Analysis of Results from Sample Simulations}

The results from sample simulations were analyzed to gain insights into the behavior of the modeled systems. Key findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quarter Car Model:} The suspension system exhibits different responses to varying road conditions, with stiffer springs providing better stability but harsher ride quality.
    \item \textbf{Pendulum:} The period of oscillation is directly proportional to the length of the pendulum and inversely proportional to the square root of the gravitational acceleration, consistent with theoretical predictions.
    \item \textbf{Mass Spring System:} The amplitude of oscillation decreases over time due to damping, and the system eventually reaches a steady state with constant energy.
\end{itemize}

These results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of our tool for simulating real-world phenomena and provide valuable insights for further analysis and experimentation.
